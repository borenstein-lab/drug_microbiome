Data and code for paper "A data-driven approach for predicting the impact of drugs on the human microbiome"

Abstract
Many medications can negatively impact the bacteria residing in our gut, depleting beneficial species, and causing adverse effects. To guide personalized pharmaceutical treatment, a comprehensive understanding of the impact of various drugs on the gut microbiome is needed, yet, to date, experimentally challenging to obtain. Towards this end, we developed a data-driven approach, integrating information about the chemical properties of each drug and the genomic content of each microbe, to systematically predict drug-microbiome interactions. We show that this framework successfully predicts outcomes of in-vitro pairwise drug-microbe experiments, as well as drug-induced microbiome dysbiosis in both animal models and clinical trials. Applying this methodology, we systematically map a large array of interactions between pharmaceuticals and human gut bacteria and demonstrate that medicationsâ€™ anti-microbial properties are tightly linked to their adverse effects. This computational framework has the potential to unlock the development of personalized medicine and microbiome-based therapeutic approaches, improving outcomes and minimizing side effects.
