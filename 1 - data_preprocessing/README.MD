This folder contains code for calculating drug properties and distance matrix from SMILES representation using RDKit 
Please see RDKit installation instructions here: https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/blob/master/Docs/Book/Install.md\
The noteboosk above were run in python3 conda envrioment.

SMILES for DrugBank compounds could be retrieved in balk using their academic license

This folder contains pre-processing files:
get_drug_descriptors.ipynb - Calculates physical-chemical descriptors from SMILES  
get_tc_distance.ipynb - Calculates TC distance from SMILES
